## Security

If you think you have found a **security issue**, open an issue and please do
not mention details in this repository. I will give you an email adress to
send as many details as possible so it can be handled confidential.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you have found a **bug** or have a **feature request** please use the
search first in case a similar issue already exists. If not, please create an
issue in this repository

## Code

If you would like to fix a bug or implement a feature, please fork the
repository and create a Pull Request.

Before you start any Pull Request, it is recommended that you create an issue
to discuss first if you have any doubts about requirement or implementation.
That way you can be sure that the maintainer(s) agree on what to change and
how, and you can hopefully get a quick merge afterwards.

## Do not force push to your Pull Request branch

Please do not force push to your Pull Requests branch after you have created
your Pull Request, as doing so makes it harder for us to review your work.
Pull Requests will always be squashed by us when we merge your work. Commit as
many times as you need in your Pull Request branch.
