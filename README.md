Did you ever see those typed commands in a terminal ? Whatever your answer, I
am convinced that you find it ambiguous and not friendly-user. You are right:
flagbox was not conceived with friendly-usage in mind. It was conceived for
efficiency. For this purpose friendly-user aspect was not a priority. If you
are searching a tool which allows you to make a similar job with a more
friendly usage, you can go to the Credit section of this README. Most of them
inspired the creation of flagbox.

flagbox is a mark manager. It allows you to save the directory you are in and
jump it later.
